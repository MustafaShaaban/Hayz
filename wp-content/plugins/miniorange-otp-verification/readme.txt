Email & SMS OTP verification for all forms. Passwordless Login. SMS Notifications. Support for External Gateway Providers. Enterprise grade. Active Support

== Description ==

= SMS & EMAIL VERIFICATION =
OTP Verification verifies Email Address/Mobile Number of users by sending verification code(OTP) during registration. It removes the possibility of a user registering with fake Email Address/Mobile Number. This plugin checks the existence of the Email Address/Mobile Number and the ability of a user to access that Email Address/Mobile Number. The plugin ships with **10 free email and 10 free SMS transactions**.

= Use third party SMS Gateway = 
In our OTP Plugin you can use any of **your own third party gateway** for sending the SMS/Email.
You can also choose to go with our **miniOrange gateway** for sending the SMS/Email.
Contact us at **otpsupport@xecurify.com/info@xecurify.com** to know more.

= WOOCOMMERCE SMS NOTIFICATION =
This is a separate add-on to the existing plugin which allows your site to send automated order and WooCommerce notifications to buyers, sellers and admins. Buyer and seller both can get **SMS notification** after an order is placed or when the order status changes. SMS notification options can be customized in the admin panel very easily. Contact us at **otpsupport@xecurify.com/info@xecurify.com** to know more.

= PASSWORDLESS LOGIN =
Passwordless Login is a modern way of **logging into your WordPress site without the use of a password**. The plugin allows you to easily setup Passwordless Login for your site. Users would now be able to log in using their Username and OTP. If you wish to allow our users to fallback to Username and Password then the plugin allows that as well.

= SEND CUSTOM MESSAGE =
This is a separate add-on to the existing plugin which allows you to **send customized SMS or EMAIL Messages to any Mobile Number or Email Address**. Contact us at **otpsupport@xecurify.com/info@xecurify.com** to know more.

= ULTIMATE MEMBER SMS NOTIFICATION =
This is a separate add-on to the existing plugin which allows your site to **send automated Ultimate Member notifications to admins and users**. SMS notification options can be customized in the admin panel very easily. Contact us at **otpsupport@xecurify.com/info@xecurify.com** to know more.

= ULTIMATE MEMBER PASSWORD RESET OVER OTP =
This is a separate add-on to the existing plugin which replaces the existing **Ultimate Member Password reset functionality with OTP Verification**. Allow users to reset their password using OTP Verification instead of email links. Contact us at **otpsupport@xecurify.com/info@xecurify.com** to know more.

= How does this plugin work? =
1. On submitting the registration form an Email/SMS with OTP is sent to the email address/mobile number provided by the user.

1. Verification of user's Email Address/Mobile Number during registration is a must these days. But what if you do not have your own SMTP/SMS gateway? With our plugin it's not necessary to have your own SMTP/SMS gateway. You can use our gateways to send OTP over Email/SMS.
2. WorldWide SMS Coverage
3. Choice to use your own SMS/SMTP Gateway.
4. Easy and hassle free setup. You just need to choose your registration form and you are good to go.
